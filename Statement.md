-   Accept user input through a terminal interface.
-   Display a formatted weather report with temperature evaluation.
-   Handle invalid numerical input gracefully.

## Target Users

-   Beginners learning Python and consolee input handling.
-   Users needing a minimal weather description tool.
-   Students working on introductory programming assignments.

## High-level Features

-   User input collection (name, city, temperature).
-   Temperature evalauation with descriptive conditions.
-   Categorized weather messages (e.g., Cool, Warm, Hot).
-   Error handling for invalid temperature entries.
